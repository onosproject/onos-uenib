UE NIB subsystem for ONOS SD-RAN (ÂµONOS Architecture)

## Overview
This subsystem provides a central location for tracking information associated 
with RAN user equipment (UE).

Applications can associate various aspects of information with each UE either for their
one purpose or for sharing such state with other applications. The API and the system itself
is designed to allow for high rate of data mutation and with minimum latency.
